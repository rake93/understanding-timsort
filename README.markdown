This is the repo corresponding to a series of blog posts I'm writing on understanding the details of timsort. It will make more sense more sense read in context with [the articles](http://www.drmaciver.com/tag/timsort/).

One thing important to note: The code as it currently is is not timsort. It's an adaptive mergesort that more or less resembles the core of timsort. As time goes on it will asymptotically converge to something that looks more like timsort.
